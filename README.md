## Part 2: Glossary
- **Branch** - a line of development<br>
- **Clone** - Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the equivalent of a local ‘git merge’ operation. GitHub also keeps the entire branch development history on the merged pull request.<br>
- **Commit** - The action of storing a new snapshot of the project’s state in the Git history, by creating a new commit representing the current state of the index and advancing HEAD to point at the new commit. <br>
- **Fetch** - get the branch’s head ref from a remote repository, to find out which objects are missing from the local object database, and to get them, too<br>
- **GIT** - open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.<br>
- **Github** - a Git hosting repository that provides developers with tools to ship better code through command line features, issues (threaded discussions) and pull requests a code for review<br>
- **Merge** -  To bring the contents of another branch (possibly from an external repository) into the current branch<br>
- **Merge Conflict** - merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge<br>
- **Push** - updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch<br>
- **Pull** -  fetch it and merge it<br>
- **Remote** - A repository which is used to track the same project but resides somewhere else<br>
- **Repository** -A collection of refs together with an object database containing all objects which are reachable from the refs<br>
